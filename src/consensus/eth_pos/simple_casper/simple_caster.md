Took a quick look at the code for the [Paper](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf)

`validator.py`
- holds the logic for tracking the blocks
- logic for handling each tick round, and broadcasting of blocks

`message.py`
- message logic

`block.py`
- block logic

Actually quite readable code, and should ook at this before [https://github.com/ethereum/casper](https://github.com/ethereum/casper) (while they have nice tests, the code at ethereum/casper is messy).
