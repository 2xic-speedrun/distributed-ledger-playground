    - `internal/rlpstruct/rlpstruct.go`
        - Logic for handling nil types
        - In addition to logic for processing fields
        - Field is a name definition of the rlp value
    - `rlpgen/`
    - `gen.go` 
        - almost 750 loc in a single file...
    - `types.go`
        - Get the representation type
    - `decode.go`
      - Logic for decoing RLP
      - `makeDecoder`
          - Mapper of the reflect types to internal types
      - Over 1000 loc in a single file.
    - `decode_test.go`
      - Well tested
    - `encbuffer.go`
      - Helper class 
    - `encode.go`
      - `makeWriter`
        - Mapper for reflect and internal types
          - Similar to `makeDecoder`
    - `encoder_test.go` 
      - Well tested
    - `raw.go`
      - Raw types
